Description: Several web services are available that provide access to elevation
             data. This package provides access to several of those services and 
             returns elevation data either as a SpatialPointsDataFrame from 
             point elevation services or as a raster object from raster 
             elevation services.  Currently, the package supports access to the
             Amazon Web Services Terrain Tiles <https://registry.opendata.aws/terrain-tiles/>, 
             the Open Topography Global Datasets API <https://opentopography.org/developers/>, 
             and the USGS Elevation Point Query Service <https://nationalmap.gov/epqs/>.
